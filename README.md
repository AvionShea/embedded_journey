# Embedded Journey 🚀

This repository documents my hands-on learning journey into embedded systems development using STM32 microcontrollers. I'm building this portfolio from the ground up — starting with the basics and progressively working toward real-world applications in defense, aerospace, and space technology.

## About Me

I'm a career-changer with over 13 years of experience in technical operations and IT, currently pursuing an AAS in Computer Programming and Development at Wake Tech Community College. My long-term goal is embedded software engineering, specifically targeting defense contractors, aerospace firms, and space technology companies.

This repo is where I document the practical side of that journey — every project, every mistake, and every breakthrough.

## Why Embedded Systems?

Embedded software powers the systems that matter most — flight computers, guidance systems, satellite telemetry, and mission-critical hardware. I want to write code that does real things in the real world, not just on a screen. This repo is my path toward that goal.

## Hardware

- **Board:** STM32 NUCLEO-F446RE
- **MCU:** STM32F446RETx — Arm Cortex-M4, 512KB Flash, 128KB RAM
- **Toolchain:** STM32CubeMX + STM32CubeIDE
- **Language:** C (HAL library)

## Projects

| Project                                         | Description           | Concepts Covered                   |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| [NUCLEO-F446RE_Blinky](./NUCLEO-F446RE_Blinky/) | Blink the onboard LED | GPIO, HAL, project setup, flashing |

_More projects coming as I progress through the curriculum._

## Learning Progression

This repo follows a deliberate, building-block approach:

- **Phase 1:** GPIO, timers, UART (getting comfortable with the hardware)
- **Phase 2:** Interrupts, PWM, ADC (real peripheral work)
- **Phase 3:** SPI, I2C, communication protocols (sensor integration)
- **Phase 4:** RTOS, real-time telemetry, IoT (production-level concepts)

## Tools & Environment

- STM32CubeIDE 2.1.0
- STM32CubeMX (standalone)
- Git / GitHub Desktop
- Windows 11
